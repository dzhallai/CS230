	In creating the software for The Gaming Room, I developed a system to manage their gaming applications, focusing on game sessions, teams, and players. This involved a GameService class, which served as a central control point. I also included Game, Team, and Player classes for handling game instances and player data.

	One of my strengths in this project was the clear depiction of the system's architecture and how various software components interacted. The process of creating a design document was enlightening, particularly in understanding how design patterns like the singleton could affect the software's performance.

	If given a chance to revise, I would enhance the analysis of different operating platforms, providing more insights into each platform's suitability for gaming applications.

	My approach to user needs was through a thorough analysis of both functional and non-functional requirements, ensuring the software was efficient, reliable, and user-friendly. Understanding user needs is critical to align the software with client and user expectations.

	For future projects, I would lean more towards iterative design methods and user-centric design principles, combined with thorough testing strategies, to ensure the software meets all necessary requirements effectively.
